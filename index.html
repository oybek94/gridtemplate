              structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
              a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
              staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
              team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
